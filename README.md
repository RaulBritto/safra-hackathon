# PresenceControlApp (BackEnd)

PresenceControlApp is an application developed for supporting teachers/professors to manage presence control of their students. As of this moment, it allows searches for students of a class and mark them as present or absent.
- BackEnd:
	The back-end exposes an API for getting the list of students registered in a class and updating the student status as present or absent. 

## Usage (for testing)
Under the project root folder (BackEnd/PresenceControlApp/)

1- Run:
	python src/PresenceControlWebApp.py
2- Run the application on the FrontEnd folder (FrontEnd/presence-control-app/), see instructions in its README.md file

To run unit tests:	
	python tests/PresenceControlTest.py
